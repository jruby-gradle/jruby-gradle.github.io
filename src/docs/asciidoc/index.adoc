= JRuby Gradle

JRuby Gradle is a set of link:http://gradle.org[Gradle] plugins which make it
easy to build, test, manage and package link:http://jruby.org[JRuby] projects.
By relying on Gradle to provide much of the basic task and dependency
management functionality, JRuby Gradle provides high quality build tooling for
Ruby and Java developers.


== Quick Start

The most basic use-case might be running some
link:http://rspec.info[RSpec]-based tests with JRuby Gradle's
link:http://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.jruby-gradle.base[base
plugin].

[source,gradle]
.build.gradle
----
/* Add the JRuby Gradle "base" plugin as a dependency of our build script */
buildscript {
    repositories { jcenter() }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.jruby-gradle:jruby-gradle-plugin:0.1.9'
    }
}

/*
 * Importing the JRubyExec type class so we can create our own JRubyExec-based
 * task below
 */
import com.github.jrubygradle.JRubyExec

dependencies {
    /* We need RSpec gems from rubygems.org to run RSpec */
    jrubyExec group: 'rubygems', name: 'rspec', version: '3.1.+'
}

task spec(type: JRubyExec) {
    group 'JRuby'
    description 'Execute the RSpecs in JRuby'
    jrubyArgs '-S'
    script 'rspec'
}
----

Using the `build.gradle` above, running `./gradlew spec` will result in the
Ruby-based dependencies being resolved and installed, then `JRubyExec` will
execute RSpec using JRuby.
