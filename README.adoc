The default branch in this repository is `documentation`, this is because
GitHub Pages uses the `master` branch to display content on
http://jruby-gradle.github.io. We use `deploy.sh` to perform a "git subtree
push" to the master branch of the content generated by
link:http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] in `html5/`.


== Building the site
